            <p>
                The INTP (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving) personality type is known as the "Thinker" or the "Architect." INTPs are analytical, logical, and creative thinkers who enjoy exploring complex ideas and solving problems. They are driven by a desire to understand the underlying principles and mechanisms of the world around them. INTPs are often seen as independent and unconventional, valuing intellectual exploration over social conventions.
                <br><br>
                INTPs are known for their curiosity and open-mindedness. They are always eager to learn and are constantly seeking new knowledge and understanding. This intellectual curiosity often leads them to question established norms and seek out innovative solutions. INTPs thrive in environments where they can engage in deep, abstract thinking and pursue their interests without constraint.
                <br><br>
                Despite their introverted nature, INTPs can be enthusiastic and passionate about their ideas. They enjoy engaging in intellectual debates and discussions, where they can test their theories and refine their understanding. However, INTPs can also be seen as aloof or detached, as they may become so absorbed in their thoughts that they appear disconnected from the outside world.
